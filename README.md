## Overview
This report focuses on the speed differences between different implementations of the Fibonacci Series. It is worth mentioning that this sequence was popularized to the Western world by Leonardo of Pisa, or Fibonacci, in the early 13th century, but its concept appeared in Indian mathematics centuries ago.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Usually the first two terms F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 start. Its mathematical expression is: 

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

The first 10 numbers of the sequence as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
